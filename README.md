# My Personal Foto Management System

Nothing yet, but with the ambition to over-engineer the crap out of it.

Planned features (not in order of priority)
- Automatic tagging using machine learning
- Automatic plotting on a map
- building an index
- re-evaluate entire tree
- set up more elaborate metadata database
- possibility to process files in bulk instead of re-opening the index every time etc.


Candidate fields for index:
- Tags
- metadata link


**Disclaimer: I designed this solely for personal use so no guarantees. But use whatever you want.**

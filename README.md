# My Personal Foto Management System

Nothing yet, but with the ambition to over-engineer the crap out of it.

Planned features (not in order of priority)
- Automatic tagging using machine learning
- Automatic plotting on a map
- building an index
- re-evaluate entire tree
- set up more elaborate metadata database
- possibility to process files in bulk instead of re-opening the index every time etc.
- set up exceptions
- compress inactive months
- automatically name fotos based on image recognition
- logic to prevent duplicates in the index.
- generate unique identifier for each picture.
- Check more thoroughly if something is an image before processing.
- âœ“ parametrize with cmnd line parameters.
- Write image object meta to json

Candidate fields for index:
- Tags
- metadata link
